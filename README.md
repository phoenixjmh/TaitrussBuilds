## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a Tetris clone, aiming for similarity to the original NES version. The challenge is to accomplish this without utilizing any external resources like online tutorials or searches. The objective is to enhance my understanding of the intricate aspects of C++ and program structure. All resources within this project are created by myself, and all sound assets are produced by Damien Mallette.
